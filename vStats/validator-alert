# This cron file defines an hourly task to check for updates to the Jumpcloud Agent
# software.  This is a safety mechanism that ensures the software can always be updated
# in cases where issues may be preventing the Agent software itself from successfully
# performing the update.

# We need to perform system related tasks, so set the PATH a bit more broadly
# to match what /etc/crontab does for system tasks.
